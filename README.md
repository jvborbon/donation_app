MALASACKIT APP: A Mobile Application for Donation Pledges


Team Members: John Vincent F. Borbon, Alexis L. Capaque and Mark Justine M. Cuerdo




Project Description: 
Charities such as The Lipa Archdiocesan Social Action Commission (LASAC) are devoted to helping communities by means of raising funds in donation appeals 
and carrying out outreach activities. Nevertheless, there is a significant proportion of people using traditional and manual ways to store donor data, 
perform donor coordinating and monitor the logistics. Such obsolete procedures tend to cause inefficiency, delays, miscommunication and may have problems 
with tracing activities or allocation of resources within donors.

In order to resolve such problems, we offer to consider the implementation of a mobile application system, the MaLASACkit Portal, which would facilitate 
the work of donors and donation process management. This system helps to streamline donor registration, tracking of donation, and distribution of resources 
and to use Prescriptive Analytics to inform decision-making and optimize the campaign plans.



Development Model: The MaLASACkit App will be developed based on Agile Methodology because it has flexibility and is iterative. This enables ongoing growth of 
the system and effortless implementation of stakeholder feedback. With user participation in the entire development of the system, we can refine the system 
regularly as per the changing needs of LASAC so that it will be efficient and responsive framework to donor management and logistics.
